# Academic Reports

This repository contains all of my end-semester result sheets. And tracks CGPA based on exam result PDFs.

## Current CGPA

**CGPA: Calculating...**

_(CGPA will be automatically updated when you push to the repository)_

## How it works

The GitHub Action workflow automatically:
1. Scans all PDF files starting with `Exam_Result_Sheet_dsce_sem`
2. Extracts SGPA values from each PDF
3. Calculates the CGPA (average of all SGPA values)
4. Updates this README with the current CGPA
